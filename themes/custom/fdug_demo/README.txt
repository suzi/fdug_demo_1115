I had to upgrade the Drush install in order to use it with D8. Since I am using homebrew all I had to do was: $ brew unlink drush then $ brew install --HEAD drush. Also the drush cache-clear all or drush cc all command is deprecated for Drupal 8 so instead I had to use drush cache-rebuild or the short version drush cr command. - See more at: https://www.appnovation.com/blog/creating-drupal-8-theme-sasssingularity-breakpoint#sthash.qhbIHaty.dpuf
